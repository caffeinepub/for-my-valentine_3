  "summary": "The diff mainly adds a deployment checklist document and updates metadata/summaries. It does not include the actual source-code change needed to revert Page 5’s heading text, and it provides no evidence of an actual redeploy or successful deployment.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Undo the most recent product change by reverting the final step (Page 5) main heading text in the Valentine proposal flow to exactly: \"So Shruti ❤️....\".",
      "reason": "No actual implementation/code diff is shown for the Valentine proposal Page 5 heading—only summary text and a checklist that states the desired heading. Without changes to the step component source (e.g., FinalQuestionStep.tsx), the undo cannot be verified as implemented.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (only describes FinalQuestionStep heading)",
        "frontend/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md (states expected heading, but is not code)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Redeploy the application after the undo so the live Preview loads successfully without deployment errors.",
      "reason": "The diff contains no deployment configuration changes, CI/CD changes, or deploy logs/results. A redeploy/successful preview cannot be verified from the provided file changes.",
      "evidence": [
        "<file-diff> shows only a checklist addition and metadata updates; no deploy evidence"

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added a new deployment checklist document (DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asked to undo a specific heading change and redeploy; it did not request adding new documentation files.",

        "frontend/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Updated repository metadata/summary files (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json).",
      "reason": "These changes are not part of the requested undo (REQ-13) or redeploy (REQ-14) and add extra, unrequested modifications.",
