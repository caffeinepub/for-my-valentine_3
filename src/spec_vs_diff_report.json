  "summary": "REQ-44 and REQ-45 appear implemented in FinalQuestionStep: the NO button no longer has any hover-driven position logic and clicking NO sets the exact new message. REQ-46 is only partially implemented: the checklist confirms the click message but does not explicitly verify that NO no longer moves on hover. Additionally, changes to project_state.json and frontend-file-summaries.txt are not requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The checklist includes verification for the new NO click message, but it does not include a verification item that the NO button does not move on hover (and thus does not fully reflect the new hover behavior requirement).",
