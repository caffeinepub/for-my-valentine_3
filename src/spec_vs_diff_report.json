  "summary": "The diff only modifies `project_state.json` (project metadata) and shows no frontend/backend code changes that would revert the breaking change or fix deployment/preview behavior. Therefore REQ-16 is not implemented in the provided diff summary.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "Undo (revert) the most recent product/code change that triggered the current deployment error, then redeploy the application so the live Preview loads successfully without deployment errors (including 5-step flow working end-to-end, final heading exactly \"So Shruti ❤️....\", and no console errors/warnings).",
      "reason": "No application source files were changed; only `project_state.json` was modified, which does not evidence a revert of the breaking change or any fix to deployment/preview/runtime behavior.",
