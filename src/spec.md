# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Undo the most recent product copy change by restoring the Page 5 main heading in the Valentine proposal flow, and ensure the app redeploys cleanly.

**Planned changes:**
- Revert the final step (Page 5) main heading text to exactly: "So Shruti ❤️....".
- Redeploy to confirm the Preview loads successfully and the 5-step flow works end-to-end without errors.

**User-visible outcome:** The final step (Page 5) displays the heading "So Shruti ❤️...." exactly, and the deployed Preview loads successfully with the full 5-step Valentine proposal flow usable.
